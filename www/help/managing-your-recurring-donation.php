		<h1>Managing Your Recurring Donation</h1>
		<p>Our payment processor is Fractured Atlas. Unfortunately they don’t provide us a for us way to change or cancel your recurring donation on your behalf, but you can change or cancel it yourself by following these steps:</p>
		<section id="log-in-to-your-fractured-atlas-account">
			<h2>1. Log in to your Fractured Atlas account</h2>
			<p>If this is your first time logging into Fractured Atlas, you’ll need to set up a new password associated with your email address. To set up a new password, visit <a href="https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org">fundraising.fracturedatlas.org</a>, then:</p>
		 	<ol>
		 		<li><p>Click “sign in/up” at the upper right-hand corner of the page.</p></li>
		 		<li><p>Then, click “Don’t Remember your Password?” and follow the prompts to set a new password.</p></li>

			<h2>2. Visit your monthly donation dashboard</h2>
			<p>Monthly donors have a donor dashboard where they can:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Update payment method for each donation.</p></li>
		    		<li><p>Update their donation amount and opt in or out of covering the fiscal sponsorship administrative fee.</p></li>
		    		<li><p>Cancel a monthly donation.</p></li>
		    	</ul>
			<p><b>Note:</b> Monthly donations processed prior to February 5, 2021 and one-time donations will not appear in this dashboard.</p>
			<p>To access this dashboard, log in to <a href="https://fundraising.fracturedatlas.org">fundraising.fracturedatlas.org</a> and click “My Donations.”</p>
			<p>Once on your monthly donation dashboard, you can also cancel your monthly donation. To cancel your donation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click the “Manage” button for the monthly donation you’d like to cancel.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click “Looking to cancel your donation?” link near the bottom of the page.</p></li>
