			$description = '<p>Faulkner’s widely-acclaimed masterpiece is well-known in America, as it’s taught in high schools across the country. In it we follow the Compson family, an aristocratic family in Mississippi, and their slow decline into poverty and ruin. What makes the novel so special—and what lends it its reputation as a challenging read—is its stream-of-consciousness style, in which Faulkner attempts to narrate the characters’ thoughts directly to the reader.</p><p><i>The Sound and the Fury</i> was an essential step in developing that modernist prose style, and is still considered to be one of the greatest works of American literature.</p>';
			break;
		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/erich-maria-remarque/all-quiet-on-the-western-front/a-w-wheen':
			$description = '<p>One of the greatest war novels to come from any conflict, Erich Maria Remarque’s grisly tale of the brutality and horror of the German trenches during the Great War was so powerful that it earned him nominations for the Nobel Prizes in <em>both</em> Literature and Peace, and was soon widely banned in a Europe that was preparing for a second cataclysmic conflict.</p>';
			break;
		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/ernest-hemingway/a-farewell-to-arms':
			$description = '<p>Called “the premier American war novel from World War I,” Hemingway’s semi-autobiographical story of an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian front, and a bright and cynical British nurse, cemented his reputation as one of the generation’s foremost literary figures. Unlike Remarque, whose <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> paints the war’s destruction in full color, Hemingway’s story is one of the mundanity of war—of the quotidian smallness that underpins even the most horrific of events.</p>';
			break;
		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-steinbeck/cup-of-gold':
			$description = '<p><i>Cup of Gold</i> is John Steinbeck’s first novel, the swashbuckling story of the real-life Captain Morgan, legendary pirate. Little of Morgan’s actual life is known, but Steinbeck fills in the blanks of this rich historical fiction with lush portraits of Caribbean ports and flourishes of magical realism.</p><p>While one might expect a rollicking tale of adventure, the novel is actually a deep meditation on the pursuit of—and inability to find—true happiness, and its skillful craft deftly foreshadows Steinbeck’s later ascension to literary titanhood.</p>';

		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/red-harvest':
			$description = '<p><i>Red Harvest</i> is Dashiell Hammett’s first full-length novel to feature the <a href="/collections/continental-op">Continental Op</a>, the nameless, hard-drinking, cynical private eye that single-handedly created the archetype of the hard-boiled detective. The novel is a fast-paced, tightly-written murder thriller that simultaneously touches all the bases of, and <em>defines</em>, the classic noir style that was much-imitated, and later much-spoofed, in the following century.</p>';

		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/sinclair-lewis/dodsworth':
			$description = '<p>Samuel Dodsworth is a successful automobile executive who decides to retire early. His younger wife Fran wants to tour Europe, so the two embark on a trip. But soon after they arrive, Fran becomes enchanted by the whirlwind of culture and old-world society, while Samuel, a mild-mannered, down-to-earth Midwesterner, yearns to escape the pretentiousness and return to the quiet stability of home. The novel explores the slow breakdown of their marriage while deftly satirizing American middle-class mores and the wide gulf between them and European culture.</p>';

He meets the fiery young Slim Girl at a tribal meet, but her reputation precedes her, and the tribe disapproves of their union. Ignoring the advice of the tribe, the two start a life together as they try to keep ancient traditions alive in the face of the rapidly-encroaching modernization of the American Southwest.</p>';

		case 'https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/graham-greene/the-man-within':
			$description = '<p><i>The Man Within</i> is acclaimed novelist Graham Greene’s first novel.

Harding suddenly passed, and winning a reelection term. Even though he was hugely popular, he declined running for a second full term, opting to retire instead. In this autobiography—which is as brief as “Silent Cal’s” legend suggests it might be—we follow the former president from his idyllic boyhood in Vermont, to a career in the law, to the governorship of Massachusetts, to the presidency and beyond.</p>';

He in turn seeks the help of his friend Sandy Arbuthnot—but Arbuthnot himself quickly goes missing. We soon head to the South American country of Olifa, where a powerful head of a mining company is gradually enslaving the populace. It seems that only guerrilla warfare will save the country from rule under a ruthless tyrant.</p>';

			$description = '<p>The recipient of the <a href="/collections/james-tait-black-memorial-fiction-prize-winners">James Tait Black Memorial Fiction Prize</a>, <i>The Good Companions</i> was a blockbuster novel that made J. B. Priestley’s reputation. In it we follow three protagonists from different walks of life who, looking for a change of pace, strike out from home. They eventually cross paths with each other and with a group of “concert players,” a type of traveling vaudeville troupe common in the day. They decide to join forces and form the “Good Companions,” a musical act that takes them on a series of cozy adventures.</p>';

It too has suffered damage, and heads to some nearby islands for repairs. In this unlikely and hostile setting, Brown, alone, pits himself against the German ship and its crew, seeking to delay its progress while British naval reinforcements rush to his rescue.</p><p>Forester’s careful historical research adds an unimpeachable air of verisimilitude to the novel, and indeed, the plot is loosely based on real events.</p>';

He gets his chance when he visits some relatives in New York, caretakers of a house in the titular Hudson River Bracketed style.</p><p>Weston is a boy of little means; perhaps it’s this vast gulf between the character’s life and Edith Wharton’s own life that allowed her to feel more free to write in many semi-autobiographical details. In any case, she considered <i>Hudson River Bracketed</i> to be her finest novel, and went so far as to write a sequel in 1932.</p>';

		<p>Happy Public Domain Day!</p>
		<p>Around the world, people celebrate Public Domain Day on January 1, the day in which copyright expires on some older works and they enter the public domain in many different countries.</p>
		<p>In the U.S. Constitution, copyright terms were meant to be very limited in order to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” The first copyright act, written in 1790 by the founding fathers themselves, set the term to be up to twenty-eight years.</p>
		<p>But since then, powerful corporations have repeatedly extended the length of copyright to promote not the progress of society, but their profit. The result is that today in the U.S., work only enters the public domain ninety-five years after publication—locking our culture away for <em>nearly a century</em>.</p>
		<p>2019 was the year in which new works were finally scheduled to enter the public domain, ending this long, corporate-dictated cultural winter. And as that year drew closer, it became clear that these corporations <em>wouldn’t</em> try to extend copyright yet again—making it the first year in almost a century in which a significant amount of art and literature once again entered the U.S. public domain, free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, share, remix, build upon, and enjoy.</p>
		<p>Ever since then, we’ve been celebrating Public Domain Day by preparing some of the year’s biggest literary hits for you to read on January 1.</p>
		<hr class="fleuron"/>
		<p><strong>On January 1, 2025, books published in 1929 enter the U.S. public domain.</strong></p>
		<p>And 1929 was a literary doozy!</p>
		<p>Books by <a href="/ebooks/william-faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="/ebooks/ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <a href="/ebooks/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, and <a href="/ebooks/john-steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> enter the U.S. public domain. Joining these esteemed names is the English translation of <i><a href="/ebooks/erich-maria-remarque/all-quiet-on-the-western-front/a-w-wheen">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></i>, the war novel so grisly that it was banned in parts of Europe; <i><a href="/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/red-harvest">Red Harvest</a></i>, the first novel starring the <a href="/collections/continental-op">Continental Op</a>, the hard-boiled noir detective who formed the archetype for every hard-drinking, fedora-wearing private eye to grace page and screen since; and much more.</p>
		<p>Our friends at the Public Domain Review have written about some <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2025/01/public-domain-day-2025/">other things that enter the public domain this year, too</a>.</p>
		<p>These past few months at Standard Ebooks, our volunteers have been working hard to prepare a selection of the books published in 1929 in advance of Public Domain Day. We’re excited to finally be able to share these <strong><?= number_format(sizeof($identifiers)) ?> new free ebooks</strong> with you!</p>
		<? if(sizeof($ebooksWithDescriptions) == 0){ ?>
