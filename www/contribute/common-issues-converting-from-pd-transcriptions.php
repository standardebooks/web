        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Lowercase words immediately following exclamations and question-marks was a common practice and should be left as is.</p>
                <figure><code class="html full"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>“Surrender you two! and confound you for two wild beasts!”<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code></figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Older PD works, especially eighteenth century and prior, often used uppercased words as a kind of emphasis. Unless they are for purposes of personification, they should be changed to lowercase.</p>
                <p>Here, “History” is a personification, but “Courtiers” is not.</p>

                <p>Therefore, “Courtiers” should be lowercased. This would be also be an editorial commit.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Semi-colons were occasionally used for elision in names; these should be replaced with the SE standard two-em dash for partial elision, three-em dash for full elision.</p>
                <p>The ellipsis in the Bishop's name is incorrect for an SE production.</p>

                <p>It should be changed to our standard two-em dash in an editorial commit.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Diacritics on words that appear in Merriam-Webster without them should generally be removed. Modernize spelling corrects some of these, so it is best to wait until after that step to see if any others are left. <code class="bash"><b>se</b> find-mismatched-diacritics</code> can help find instances of these. These commit(s) should be editorial.</p>
                <p>The circumflex on hôtel is unnecessary:</p>

                <p>And therefore can be removed.</p>

                <p>Words and/or phrases that are italicized in the source, or italicized and quoted, should be changed to match SE standards. For example, it may be italicized in the source, but should be quoted according to our style manual. Or, an English phrase may be quoted and italicized, and only one is necessary (usually the quotes).</p>
                <p>Here, song lyrics are both quoted and italicized.</p>
