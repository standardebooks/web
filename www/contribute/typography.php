		<h1>Typography Manual</h1>
		<aside class="alert">
			<p>Standard Ebooks is a brand-new project&mdash;this manual is a pre-alpha, and much of it is incomplete. If you have a question, need clarification, or run in to an issue not yet covered here, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/standardebooks">contact us</a> so we can update this manual.</p>
		</aside>
		<h2>The Standard Ebooks Style Philosophy</h2>
		<p>Standard Ebooks’ goal is to bring classic public domain literature into the digital era by making it accessible, attractive, and by maintaining a high standard of quality. To that end we’re not interested in slavishly reproducing the formatting quirks, transcription errors, publisher’s ephemera, or other inconsequential style decisions of the past. While we strive to be good custodians of the literature entrusted to the public, we recognize that the freedom of the public domain intersects with the Internet era in a way that allows us to present that literature in an attractive, modern, and high-quality way.</p>
		<h2>Your task</h2>
		<p>As an editor, proofreader, or producer of a Standard Ebook, part of your task is to take the source transcription of your ebook and apply this typography manual to it. This manual outlines various standardizations and modernizations to old typography practices, making older texts easier to read for modern readers.</p>
		<p>Many of the rules below have been accepted standards for a hundred years or more. That means that many of the ebooks you produce may not need that much adjustment. The <code class="program">typogrify</code> tool in the <a href="https://github.com/standardebooks/tools">Standard Ebooks toolset</a> also automatically takes care of some (but not all!) of these rules. Typically, the older the source, the more of these rules you’ll have to check during production.</p>
		<h2>Normalizing different formatting styles</h2>
		<p>Our general rule is: <b>If it doesn’t affect the meaning of the work, then normalize it according to these standards.</b></p>
		<section id="common-problems">
			<h2>Common problems to keep an eye out for</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Some sources use a two-em-dash to interrupt dialog. You should replace such two-em-dashes with a single em-dash according to the <a href="#dashes">section on dashes</a>.</p>
					<figure class="text">
						<p class="wrong">&ldquo;Why, I never&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she cried.</p>
						<p class="corrected">&ldquo;Why, I never&mdash;&rdquo; she cried.</p>
					</figure>
					<p>Note that a two-em-dash is <em>also</em> used to signify a missing or purposefully obscured word. This is correct, but you should ensure that instead of two consecutive em-dashes, you use the two-em-dash glyph (⸺ or U+2E3A) for <em>partially</em>-obscured words, the three-em-dash glyph (⸻ or U+2E3B) for <em>completely</em>-obscured words, and a single em-dash for partially-obscured <em>years</em>.</p>
					<figure class="text">
						<p class="corrected">Sally J⸺ walked through the town of ⸻ in the year 19—.</p>
					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Small caps are commonly used instead of italics for emphasis in older texts, and some transcriptions use all caps instead of italics. These should generally be converted to regular case and wrapped in <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code> tags. If a text truly does call for extreme emphasis, the <code class="html">&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag can be used&mdash;but think twice about using it, and use it sparingly. See the <a href="#text-in-all-caps">section on text in all caps</a>.</p>
					<figure class="text">
						<p class="wrong">That donut was DELICIOUS!</p>
						<p class="corrected">That donut was &lt;em&gt;delicious&lt;/em&gt;!</p>

		<section id="general">
			<h2>General</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Our general style guide is the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition, with a few tweaks outlined below. Work following a different style guide should be converted to conform to ours, unless it changes the meaning of the work.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><em>Do</em> convert from logical punctuation to American punctuation where possible.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><em>Do</em> convert from British quotation to American quotation where possible. The <code class="program">british2american</code> script is helpful for automating most (but not all!) of this.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="section-endings">
			<h2>Section endings</h2>
			<p>Some older books end with “The End”, “Fin”, or some other equivalent. Remove these.</p>
			<p>Some books also end individual sections or chapters with “The end of such-and-such section”. Remove these as well.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="chapters">
			<h2>Chapter names and titles</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>In the body text, always use Roman numerals for chapter numbers instead of Arabic numerals. But in an individual file’s <code class="html">&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, <em>do</em> use Arabic numbers instead of Roman numerals.</p>
					<p><em>Do not</em> use the Unicode Roman numeral glyphs, as they are deprecated; use regular letters.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Convert all-caps or small-caps titles to title case. Use the <code class="program">se titlecase</code> script in the <a href="https://github.com/standardebooks/tools">Standard Ebooks toolset</a> for consistent titlecasing.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Remove trailing periods from chapter titles.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Omit the word “Chapter” from chapter titles.</p>
					<p>Some ebooks should keep “Chapter” in titles if clarity is necessary: for example, <i><a href="/ebooks/mary-shelley/frankenstein/">Frankenstein</a></i> has “Chapter” in titles to differentiate between the “Letter” sections.</p>
					<figure class="text">

		</section>
		<section id="italics-or-quotes">
			<h2>Italicizing or quoting newly-used words</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>When introducing new terms, italicize foreign or technical terms, but use quotation marks for terms composed of regular English.</p>
					<figure class="text">
						<p class="corrected">English whalers have given this the name “ice blink.”</p>
						<p class="corrected">The soil consisted of that igneous gravel called <i>tuff</i>.</p>
					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Don’t italicize English neologisms in works where a special vocabulary is a regular part of the narrative; specifically, science fiction works that may necessarily contain made-up English technology words. However, <em>do</em> italicize “alien” language in such works.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Including <em>both</em> italics <em>and</em> quotes, outside of the context of quoted dialog, is usually not necessary. Use one or the other based on the rules above.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="names-and-titles">
			<h2>Names and titles: Italicize or quote?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Names and titles are usually <em>either</em> italicized <em>or</em> quoted, but almost never both. Pick one or the other based on the rules below.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Older work may pick the opposite of the rules below; change such texts to match this manual.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Older work may use quotation marks around proper names, like pub, bar, building, or company names. Remove those quotes.</p>
					<figure class="text">

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In general, italicize things that can stand alone. Specifically:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Magazines</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Plays</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Books and novels <em>except</em> “holy texts,” like the Bible or books within the Bible</p>

			<h2>Capitalization</h2>
			<section id="capitalization-general">
				<h3>General</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Some very old works frequently capitalize nouns that today we no longer capitalize.

				<h3>Text in all caps</h3>

			<h2>Italics</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Italics should generally be used for emphasis. Some older texts make frequent use of small caps for emphasis; change these to italics. Italics indicating emphasis must be wrapped with the <code class="html">&lt;em&gt;</code> tag.</p>

						<p>If a certain foreign word is used so frequently in the text that italicizing it would be distracting to the reader, then only italicize the first instance. However, wrap the following instances in <code class="html">&lt;span xml:lang="LANGUAGE"&gt;</code>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Certain exceptions to italicizing foreign words can be made if a specific word is in Merriam-Webster, but in the producer’s opinion is still too obscure for the general reader and thus should be italicized anyway. In this case ask the Standard Ebooks editor-in-chief for how to proceed.</p>

				<h3>Dashes</h3>
				<p>There are many kinds of dashes, and your run-of-the-mill hyphen is often not what you should use. In particular, don’t use the hyphen for things like date ranges, phone numbers, or negative numbers.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Do not put spaces around em-dashes. Remove spaces if in the original text.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Use em-dashes (— or U+2014) to offset parenthetical phrases. These are usually the most common kind of dash.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Use an em-dash for partially-obscured years.</p>
						<figure class="text">
							<p class="corrected">It was the year 19— in the town of Metrolopis.</p>

						<p>Use a regular hyphen if only the last digit of the year is obscured.</p>
						<figure class="text">
							<p class="corrected">It was the year 186- in the town of Metrolopis.</p>
						</figure>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Some older texts use two em-dashes to indicate an interruption in thought or speech. Our style is to replace two em-dashes used as an interruption marker with a single em-dash. However, <em>don’t</em> replace two em-dashes used to indicate the omission of a word (like an anonymous name or an expletive); see below.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Use a two-em-dash glyph (⸺ or U+2E3A) to signify a purposefully <em>partially</em> obscured word. The two-em-dash glyph isn’t available in some fonts, but include it anyway; our build process will convert it later.</p>
						<figure class="text">
							<p class="corrected">Sally J⸺ walked through town.</p>

					<p>An initialism is a term made up of initials in which each initial is pronounced separately: <abbr class="initialism">ABC</abbr>, <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr>, <abbr class="initialism">CSS</abbr>.</p>
					<p>A contraction is an abbreviation of a longer word: Mr., Mrs., lbs.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In general, abbreviations ending in a lowercase letter should be set without spaces and followed by a period. Abbreviations without lowercase letters should be set without spaces and without a trailing period. Always use a no-break space after an abbreviation that describes the next word, like Mr., Mrs., Mt., St., etc. A few exceptions follow.</p>

				<li>
					<p>Initials of people’s names should be separated by periods and spaces. Wrap such initials in <code class="html">&lt;abbr class="name"&gt;</code>.</p>

				<p>Some older texts use ligatures like æ and œ to represent dipthongs. The modernize-spelling tool will replace many of these for you, but keep an eye out for other instances, particularly in Latin phrases and in classical names such as Œdipus. These should be either be replaced with “ae” and “oe” or with alternative modern spellings of the word they are in (check Merriam-Webster for these).</p>

					<p>“Ibid.” is a Latinism commonly used in endnotes to indicate that the source for a quotation or reference is the same as the last-mentioned source.</p>
					<p>In the case where the last-mentioned source is in the previous endnote, we must replace Ibid. by the full reference; since ebooks use popup endnotes, “Ibid.” becomes meaningless in that context.</p>
					<p>In the case where the last-mentioned source is in the same endnote as Ibid., we can leave Ibid. untouched.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The endnote reference number goes after ending punctuation. If the endnote references an entire sentence in quotation marks, or the last word in a sentence in quotation marks, then the endnote reference number goes outside the quotation marks.</p>
