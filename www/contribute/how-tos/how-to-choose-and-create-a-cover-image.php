					<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
					<p>Every cover image must be approved by either the Editor in Chief or the manager assigned to your project. Until your chosen image has been approved, <strong>do not</strong> add it to your repository. If you commit early and your artwork is not approved, you may need to rebase your repository to remove all traces of the image.</p>
				</li>
				<li id="where-to-find">
					<h2>Where to Find Public Domain Cover Art</h2>
					<p>Your cover image must be provably in the public domain in the United States. Standard Ebooks has strict guidelines for proving that your cover art is in the public domain. There are three ways to demonstrate public domain status:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Choose art from the <a href="/artworks">Standard Ebooks Artwork Database</a>;</p></li>
						<li><p>Download art from a museum collection under a CC0 license; or</p></li>
						<li><p>Find art printed in a public domain book.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Because U.S. copyright law is complicated, one of these three methods is <i>required</i> in order to demonstrate that the painting you selected is in fact in the U.S. public domain, with no exceptions. Just because a painting is very old, or Wikipedia says it’s PD, or it’s PD in a country besides the U.S., doesn’t necessarily mean it actually is PD in the U.S.</p>
					<ol>
						<li id="where-to-find-se-database">
							<h3>The Standard Ebooks Cover Database</h3>
							<p>Standard Ebooks maintains a <a href="/artworks">database of US-public-domain art</a>. The art included in this database has been reviewed by at least two S.E. volunteers and includes links to the image and the proof of copyright.</p>
							<p>Choosing pre-approved art from the database is as simple as searching by artist, title, or keyword.</p>
							<p>Please remember that even art from the database needs to be approved on the list before it is added to your repository.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="where-to-find-museums-with-cc0">
							<h3>Museums with CC0 Copyright Licenses</h3>
							<p>If there is nothing in the database that fits, you can also find public domain art in online museum collections.</p>
							<p>You can use a painting from an online museum collection without further proof <strong>only if</strong> the museum that holds the original work of art has released it via the CC0 license. The CC0 deed is a legal document by which the museum waives any and all copyright in the image and the underlying work itself. S.E. <strong>does not</strong> accept other public domain declarations (not even other Creative Commons declarations such as CC-PDM).</p>
							<p>Below you will find an <a href="#resources-cc0">extensive list of museums with CC0 collections</a>. Please be sure to check the individual license; not every artwork at every listed museum will have the same license. Only works marked as CC0 will be approved.</p>
						</li>
						<li id="where-to-find-published-art">
							<h3>Art Published in a Public Domain Book</h3>
							<p>The final way to clear a painting for use as a cover image is to locate a reproduction of that painting in a book published before <?= PD_STRING ?>. This option gives you the most freedom in finding a suitable image, but it can be difficult; proving an artwork’s public domain status this way can sometimes be the most time-consuming part of the ebook production process.</p>
							<p>This process involves: (1) identifying a work of art that you think will be a suitable cover, then (2) finding book page scans with a reproduction of that artwork in a book published before <?= PD_STRING ?> at an online book archive like the Internet Archive, Google Books, or Hathi Trust. (Note that if your IP address is not in the U.S., some book archives may disable book previews.)</p>
							<section>
								<h4>Public Domain Proof Tips</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><p>Many museum online catalogs have a “bibliography” or “references” section for each painting in their collection, which is a list of books in which the painting was either mentioned or reproduced. This is a good shortcut to finding page scans of a book with reproductions, and if you’re lucky, a search for the book title in Google Books will turn up scans.</p></li>
									<li><p>Remember that paintings often go by many different titles in different languages; your best bet is to search for an artist’s last name instead.</p></li>
									<li><p>Artists often had various spellings of their names, especially ones in non-Latin alphabets (like <a href="/artworks/ilya-repin">Ilya Repin</a>). Make sure to try several spelling variants to ensure you find them in art books.</p></li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Public Domain Proof Pitfalls</h4>
								<p>There are some things you need to be especially careful of when using this method:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>In older books it was common to have etchings of paintings. Etchings are not strict reproductions, and so we cannot count them for PD clearance. Etchings can sometimes be identified by: (1) having more clearly defined lines, or shading with more contrast; (2) having shading done with a stipple effect; (3) differences in small amorphous details like the shape of clouds, trees, or fabric compared to the original painting. Etchings mostly fell out of use by around 1900.</p></li>
									<li><p>Painters often produced several different versions of the same artwork. For PD clearance, your scan must be of the exact version you will be using. Carefully compare the two. Check for differences in small details, like the position of trees, clouds, reflections, or water. Any difference and the proof will be rejected.</p></li>
									<li><p>Do not rely on the date given in the catalog entry at Hathi Trust or the Internet Archive; these can be wrong. Please verify the page scan of the copyright page to ensure the book was published before <?= PD_STRING ?>.</p></li>

					<h2>Choosing Suitable Art</h2>
					<p>When choosing cover art, you also need to make sure it is suitable for Standard Ebooks and for your book in particular. The main considerations are:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><b>House Style.</b> The Manual of Style states that:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Cover art is in the “fine art oil painting” style, and in full color. Artworks not in this style, like ink drawings, woodcuts, medieval-style “flat” paintings, pencil sketches, modern CG art, or black-and-white scans, are not acceptable. Generally, watercolors are not acceptable, though some watercolors *may* be accepted if their appearance is oil-painting-like.</p>
								<p>Cover art is not a very famous or easily-recognizable painting, like Da Vinci’s <i>Mona Lisa</i> or Van Gogh’s <i>Starry Night</i>.</p>
								<p>Cover art is not AI-generated.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>Beyond those basic requirements, there are a few more specific considerations:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><b>Science fiction.</b> For works of twentieth century science fiction, more abstract or modernist cover art is a good bet, as for obvious reasons there are few fine art oil paintings of science fiction subjects. Starting around the 1910s dust jackets of fantasy and science fiction books began featuring oil paintings, which can be used as the S.E. cover for their respective books.</p>
								</li>
								<li><p><b>Compilations.</b> It can be difficult to find a single image that sums up a collection of short stories, poems, or essays. A portrait of the author can be a good choice here, if available.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Orientation and Crop.</b> Remember that your final cover art will have to be taller than it is wide, with a ratio of 3:2 height to width. Most art is wider than this and will need to be cropped to fit. If you start with a wide landscape painting, you may only be able to use a small slice of it.</p>
							<p>Also, remember that our tools add a title and author box to the bottom of the cover. If there is important detail in that area then the artwork can’t be used. Sometimes creative cropping can help avoid this problem.</p>
							<p>You need to use image editing software to create a final cover image exactly 1400 pixels wide and 2100 pixels tall. If you don’t already have one, <a href="https://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> is a free, open source image editor that is available for Mac, Windows and Linux.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Duplication.</b> Make sure your image hasn’t already been used as a Standard Ebooks cover image. You can <a href="/artworks">search the S.E. Cover Art Database</a> by artist name to check if your cover is already in use.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Resolution.</b> The final cover image must be exactly 2100 pixels high and 1400 pixels wide. If you upscale a low-resolution image, the result can be muddy and unflattering. Therefore, finding a reproduction of a suitable resolution is important.</p>
							<p>It is possible to upscale an image that is smaller than 2100 × 1400. If it only needs to be upscaled a small amount, most image editors like <a href="https://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> will give good results. New AI image editing tools like <a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/gigapixel">Gigapixel</a> can also get good results from very low resolution source images. If you’re not experienced with these tools yourself, ask on the mailing list; someone there should be able to help you.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Compromise.</b> Every producer wants to find the perfect match for their project, but remember, you also need to find a cover that is high enough resolution and, most importantly, public domain. So, be ready to compromise.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li id="approval">
					<h2>Getting Artwork Approved</h2>
					<p>Before you add any cover image to your project, you need to have it approved on the S.E. list by the editor assigned to your project, or by the Editor-in-Chief. Just post in your project thread, and include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>A link to your proof of public domain status. This may be a link to the S.E. cover art database, to a museum listing with a CC0 declaration, or to the page images of a print appearance.</p></li>
						<li><p>A mockup of your cover, including the Standard Ebooks title block.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Creating a mockup is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Make a copy of the cover.svg file from your project’s <code class="path">./images</code> folder (<strong>not</strong> from <code class="path">./src/epub/images</code>) and move it somewhere outside of your project.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Rename your edited cover image to <code class="path">cover.jpg</code> and copy it into the same folder.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Open your copy of <code class="path">cover.svg</code> with any application that can read SVG files. Because <code class="path">cover.svg</code> includes a link to <code class="path">cover.jpg</code>, you should see a complete cover image as long as both files are in the same folder.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Export the cover image as a PNG file to post on the mailing list.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
